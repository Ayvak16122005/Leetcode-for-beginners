view: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions/6206490/cracking-the-code-mastering-the-two-sum-tvdec/

problem statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

Solution code:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        num_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]
            num_map[num] = i

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
solution = Solution()
print(solution.twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]

```
Notes For my people:
**********
Scenario:
Imagine you're at a grocery store with a friend, and you both have a shopping list. You have a budget of ₹100, and you need to buy two items that together cost exactly ₹100. You have a list of items with their prices, and you need to find out which two items you can buy without exceeding your budget.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Shopping List: You have a list of items with their prices:

Apples: ₹30
Bananas: ₹20
Oranges: ₹50
Grapes: ₹40

Budget: Your budget is ₹100.

Goal: Find two items that together cost exactly ₹100.

Brute Force Approach:
You and your friend decide to check all possible pairs of items to see if their combined price matches your budget. This is like the brute force approach:
Check Apples (₹30) + Bananas (₹20) = ₹50 (Not a match)
Check Apples (₹30) + Oranges (₹50) = ₹80 (Not a match)
Check Apples (₹30) + Grapes (₹40) = ₹70 (Not a match)
Check Bananas (₹20) + Oranges (₹50) = ₹70 (Not a match)
Check Bananas (₹20) + Grapes (₹40) = ₹60 (Not a match)
Check Oranges (₹50) + Grapes (₹40) = ₹90 (Not a match)
This approach is time-consuming because you have to check every possible pair.

Hash Map Approach:
Instead, you decide to use a more efficient method. You create a list of items you've already checked and their prices. This is like using a hash map:
Initialization: Start with an empty list (hash map).
Iteration: Go through each item on your list:
Check Apples (₹30): The complement to reach ₹100 is ₹70. Add Apples to the list.
Check Bananas (₹20): The complement to reach ₹100 is ₹80. Add Bananas to the list.
Check Oranges (₹50): The complement to reach ₹100 is ₹50. Add Oranges to the list.
Check Grapes (₹40): The complement to reach ₹100 is ₹60. Add Grapes to the list.
Finding the Match: As you check each item, you also check if the complement (the amount needed to reach ₹100) is already in your list:
When you check Oranges (₹50), you see that the complement (₹50) is already in your list (Oranges itself). So, you have found the two items that together cost ₹100: Oranges and Oranges.
In this case, the hash map approach helps you find the solution more efficiently by keeping track of the items you've already checked and their prices.

Conclusion:
The "Two Sum" problem is similar to this grocery store scenario. You need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The hash map approach allows you to do this efficiently by keeping track of the numbers you've already seen and their complements.
